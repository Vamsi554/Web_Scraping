# Data Scraping

1) Data Scraping, also known as Web Scraping, is the process of importing information from a website into a spreadsheet or local file saved onto your computer. It's one of the efficient ways to get data from web.
2) It's also termed as screen scraping, web data extraction and web harvesting etc..
3) It's a technique employed to extract large amounts of data from websites whereby data is extracted and then analysis tasks can be performed.
4) Data displayed by most websites can only be viewed using a web browser. They do not offer the functionality to save a copy of this data for personal use. 
5) The only option then is to manually copy and paste the data which is a very tedious job which can take many hours or sometimes days to complete.
6) Web Scraping is a process and technique of automating this process, so that instead of manually copying the data from websites, the Web Scraping software will perform the same task within a fraction of the time.
7) Normally, data transfer between programs is accomplished using data structures suited for automated processing by computers, not people. Such interchange formats and protocols are typically rigidly structured, well-documented, easily parsed, and keep ambiguity to a minimum. Very often, these transmissions are not human-readable at all.
8) Thus, the key element that distinguishes data scraping from regular parsing is that the output being scraped is intended for display to an end-user, rather than as input to another program, and is therefore usually neither documented nor structured for convenient parsing. 
9) Data scraping often involves ignoring binary data (usually images or multimedia data), display formatting, redundant labels, superfluous commentary, and other information which is either irrelevant or hinders automated processing.
10) Data scraping is generally considered an adhoc, inelegant technique, often used only as a "last resort" when no other mechanism for data interchange is available. 

# Web Scraping

1) Web pages are built using text-based mark-up languages (HTML and XHTML), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form. 
2) However, most web pages are designed for human end-users and not for ease of automated use. Because of this, tool kits that scrape web content were created.
3) A web scraper is an API or tool to extract data from a web site.
4) Companies like Amazon AWS and Google provide web scraping tools, services and public data available free of cost to end users. 
5) Newer forms of web scraping involve listening to data feeds from web servers. For example, JSON is commonly used as a transport storage mechanism between the client and the web server.
6) Recently, companies have developed web scraping systems that rely on using techniques in DOM parsing, computer vision and natural language processing to simulate the human processing that occurs when viewing a webpage to automatically extract useful information.

# Popular Uses of Data Scraping 
	
1) Research for web content/business intelligence
2) Pricing comparision sites
3) Sending data from one system to another system

# Multiple uses for the data scraping

# Gathering Desperate Data

1) One of the great advantages of data scraping is that it can help you gather all the data in one place.
2) Crawling allows us to take unstructured, scattered data from multiple sources & collect them under a single source and make it as structured.
3) If we have multiple websites controlled by different entities, we can combine them all into one single feed.

# Expediting Research

1) The simplest use of data scraping is that we can retrieve data from single source.
2) If there is a web page containing a lot of useful information, the easiest way to get the information would be data scraping.

# Outputting an XML feed to third-party sites

1) Feeding product data from your site to other third party sites is a key application of data scraping for e-commerce.
2) It allows us to potentially laborious process of updating our product details.

# Dark Side of Data Scraping

1) Even though there are many uses for data scraping, still it gets abused by many.
2) The most prevalent misuse of data scraping is email harvesting - scraping of data from websites, social media and directories to uncover people email addresses, which are then sold to spammers.

# Why we need to scrape web data?

1) Typically companies do not want their unique content to be downloaded and reused for unauthorized purposes. As a result, they donâ€™t expose all data via a consumable API or other easily accessible resource.
2) Web Scrapers, on the other hand, are interested in getting website data regardless of any attempt at limiting access

# Web Scraping can occur at Three Steps.

1) First the piece of code used to pull the information sends an HTTP GET request to a specific website.
2) When the website responds, the scraper parses the HTML document for a specific pattern of data.
3) Once the data is extracted, it is converted into whatever specific format we require.
